# My Learning Journey

Hi, I'm raggnatron.  
I'm learning Python and GitHub â€“ in my own tempo.

This repo is my notebook, my timeline, and my proof that small steps build something big.

## What I'm learning:
- Python basics and projects  
- Git & GitHub workflow  "20250512 first update"
- Coding in English  

## Why I'm here:
Because I believe in slow growth with purpose.

Let's see what I become.
