# My Learning Journey

Hi, I´m raggnatron.
I´m learning Python and GitHub - in my own tempo.

This repo is my notebook, my timeline, and my proof that small steps build somethings big.

## What I´m learning:
-Python basics and projects 
-Git & GitHub workflow
-coding in English

##Why I´m here:
Because I believe in slow growth whis purpose.

Let´s see what I become.
